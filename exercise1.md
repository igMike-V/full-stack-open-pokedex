An open-source application is being developed in Python by a team of 6 engineers, three for the front end and another three for the back end.  they will be using GitHub for version control and issue tracking, Since they are using github it makes sense to use github actions to run a CI environment, however, there are other such tools available such as: Jenkins, CircleCI, TravisCI, GitLab, Buddy, and Banboo. 

They might use the following steps in a CI setup. we might start with testing dependencies using a package management system like Conda or Pipenv. A package management system will install run and update all the packages and their dependencies.  Next we would want to do some testing.  For this, we might use pytest to test the code within our CI workflow, we could also use nose or unit test test runners.  to make sure all developers are following strict code styles we can test using a listing package like pylint. we would need to manage the packaging process. for that we could use pip to bring together all the necessary files and upload it to the Python Package Index. To build we would need a build tool such as Paver or Scons
